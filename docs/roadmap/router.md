# Router / Conductor Notes

## Scope
- Intent classification, plan creation, multi-hop orchestration, final summaries.

## Current Status
- Keyword matrix only; no registry-aware or LLM-backed routing.

## Upcoming
- Integrate registry metadata, ChangeManifest deltas, and upstream results into routing decisions.
- Prototype LLM-based router once Phase 4 begins.

## Metrics to Capture
- `routing_accuracy`
- `plans_multi_hop`
- Average planning latency (ms)
