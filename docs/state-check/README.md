# State Check Documents

This directory contains dated snapshots of system state metrics and progress updates.

## Purpose

State check documents capture:
- Performance metrics (registry scan times, test durations)
- Implementation status of roadmap items
- Pain points and missing guardrails
- Progress deltas between snapshots

## File Naming Convention

Files are named with the date they were created: `YYYY-MM-DD-state-check.md`

## Usage

When creating a new state check:
1. Copy the latest state check to a new file with today's date
2. Update metrics from recent test runs
3. Document new implementations or changes since the last check
4. Highlight deltas from the previous snapshot

This creates a historical record of the project's evolution and helps track progress against roadmap milestones.
